# Feature Inventory

## MVP Features

- Official source registry with source ownership, jurisdiction, verification date, and hashes.
- Content validation pipeline for source records, exam config, fallback question data, local images, and unofficial support layers.
- Category B practice question presentation in Spanish with source traceability and non-official fallback labeling.
- Clearly labeled unofficial Russian translation and explanation layers.
- Learning mode with answer feedback and linked weak-topic hints.
- Exam mode driven by `content/config/caba-exam-format.json` with approximate/exact status labeling.
- Mistake tracking and repeated-error review loop.
- Exam-oriented vocabulary module with topic grouping and search.
- Guide module focused on CABA-vs-RF differences that matter for exam outcomes.
- Offline-capable local-first behavior after build.
- Docker-only local runtime with `make build`, `make up`, and `make down`.

## Current Content Mode

- Current question content mode: `unofficial_b_fallback`.
- Reason: no complete public official CABA category B question bank has been confirmed.
- Source used for practice questions: `bandinopla/simulador-test-de-conducir`, category B/CABA, Apache-2.0, explicitly non-official upstream.
- Important boundary: A/A4, motorcycle, and other non-B question sources are not used for practice questions.
- Source guard behavior: this is a source-level eligibility rule, not a text-level topic filter. Valid category B practice material may mention motorcycles, motovehicles, ciclomotors, parking areas, lanes, signs, or other shared-road topics when the source `practiceQuestionScope` explicitly allows category B.
- Question images are part of the learning surface and are stored locally in the repository for offline use.

## Post-MVP Candidates

- Spaced-repetition scheduling.
- Progress import/export.
- Additional jurisdictions outside CABA.
- Additional translation languages.
- Alternative frontend framework evaluation.

## Explicit Out Of Scope (Current)

- Full Spanish-language learning curriculum.
- Practical driving instruction workflows.
- User accounts and cloud sync.
- Always-on backend services.
